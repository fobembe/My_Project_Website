# [Project 1: Predicting Employee Attrition](https://github.com/fobembe/People-Analytics) 
This project analyzed factors that causes employee attrition with the aim of recommending solutions to corporate organizations in managing their human resource aseets. Three algorithms were considered for this project i.e. Logistic Regression, KNN and Random Foreset Classifier.  Using the GridSearchCV, the RF classifier was selected and used for the modelinig. The top ten most important factors causing employee attrition include;
* monthly income. 
* age.
* total working years. 
* years working with the company. 
* years working with current manager. 
* years in current role, etc.

# [Project 2: Predicting Customers' Churn in Telecom](https://github.com/fobembe/Telecom_Churn_Prediction)

The aim of any business enterprise is to maximize profits through the provision of quality goods and services. Profit maximization is very essential for a business to fufill its various obligations in the society. For instance, businesses provides employment opportunities to the people, pays taxes to the government which are used to provide amenities, and other responsibilities to the wider society. However, this objective can be threatened if customers keep churning the business. The major objective of this project is to examine a telecommunication's company's data and try to infer why customers churn the business. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle and has so many features of the customers. Churn in this dataset is a dichotomous variable which is denoted as "Yes" or "No".  Using KNN classifier, the model was able to record 74% accuracy in classifying customers that churn.
